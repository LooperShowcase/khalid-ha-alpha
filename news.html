        In the last 10 years, the slice of vehicle sales that were cars has
        plummeted in the United States from about 50 percent to less than 25
        percent. That's why the only car in a Ford showroom is the Mustang and
        the only cars at your Buick dealer are used. The premium-car makers
        haven't been immune to this trend, and Mercedes-Benz's car percentage
        fell from 80 percent levels in the early part of the century to less
        than 30 percent this year. Obviously, this results in fewer cars being
        sold, with the brand's two-seaters under particular pressure. The
        smaller SLC roadster was discontinued last year, and the even the
        venerable SL skipped the 2021 model year.

      When Mercedes abruptly pulled the vast majority of its V-8 models from the
      U.S. market for the upcoming model year, it did something not just bizarre
      in the conservative auto business but unheard of in any sector. It’s
      certainly not typical for a large automaker with huge manufacturing
      capacity to close the ordering books on its most popular and profitable
      products—especially when many of those models have recently debuted. As
      for why, the company can't seem to get its story straight.
